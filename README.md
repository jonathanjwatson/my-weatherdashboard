I. Description

This project consit of building a weatherdashboard that can help you check on the temperature in most of the cities around the world.
This app is designed to give you the ability to access the weather forecast of most of the cities if not all the cities of the world. I designed it by using the concepts learned in school such as HTML, CSS, the Basic concepts of Javascript, the Dom manipulation and finally the access of API through the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
